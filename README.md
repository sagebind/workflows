# Workflows

Some [reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/reusing-workflows) for GitHub Actions to make my life easier.

This repository primarily holds [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)-focused workflows since most of my open-source work tends to use Rust, but I might add other workflows as well specific to my needs for any open-source projects I maintain.
